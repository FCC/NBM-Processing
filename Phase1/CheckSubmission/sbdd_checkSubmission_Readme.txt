This package contains the following files:

- SBDD_Reciept_Overview_v1.xls: a list of the fields and logic to be checked by the checkSubmission tool
- SBDD_Check.tbx: an ESRI 10.0 tool box file
- SBDD_CheckSubmission.py: the python script for checking the submission


Running the tool
- After loading your data into the Data Transfer Model, add the tbx file above to ArcCatalog.  We 
  strongly suggest using ArcCatalog over ArcMap for a number of reasons.  

- With the .tbx file added to ArcToolbox, run the script named SBDDCheckSubmission (the only script
  in the toolbox).  The script will check the values in fields in each feature class loaded in the
  transfer data model. It also performs the check and validate geometry tools.  This script might take
  a long time due to the volume of data in your submission.

- The arguments to run the script are; (a) the feature dataset inside the trasfer data model; (b) the
  two letter state abbreviation for your state/district/territory; (c) the output folder for the reciept

- The script runs a series of logic checks (see SBDD_Reciept_Overview_v1.xls) and outputs a file named:
  <output_folder><state_abbreviation>_<year>_<month>_<day>.txt (e.g. c:/users/DE_2001_3_14.txt).  This
  text file contains the results of the checks run by the script.  The results of the submission are in 
  this text file.

- You will need to check this script for any 'FAILED' printed results.  A FAILED result means there are
  unexpected values in your data submission.  You will need to locate the values, fix the issues and 
  rerun the tool.

- We would like you to submit the reciept file (the .txt file generated by the tool) with your submission.

NOTES:
- PLEASE NOTE: THIS TOOL RUNS THE ESRI CHECK AND REPAIR GEOMETRY TOOLS.  THESE TOOLS MIGHT CHANGE RECORD
  NUMBERS, GEOMETRY AND/OR FEATURES ON YOUR DATA.  WE ARE RUNNING THIS DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME OF NON-
  VALID GEOMETRIES SUBMITTED IN PAST SUBMISSION.  IT IS A BEST PRACTICE TO RUN THESE TOOLS INDIVIDUALLY
  ON SAMPLE DATA PRIOR TO RUNNING THE CHECKSUBMISSION TOOL SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH GEOMETRY ISSUES 
  CONTAINED IN YOUR SUBMISSION.

- THIS TOOL REQUIRES AN ARCINFO LICENSE TO RUN.  

- THIS TOOL WAS CREATED AND TESTED IN ARCGIS 10.0

- THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERSION 1.2 AND 1.1 IS THE REMOVAL OF CHECKING MAXIMUM ADVERTISED SPEED IN 
  THE OVERVIEW TABLE.
