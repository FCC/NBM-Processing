This directory contains the scripts which create the reciept file
The script is run off of the delivered file geodatabases.
- SBDD_CreateSpatialLayers.py

##Arguments
theFD = sys.argv[1]  #theFeatureDataSet 
					 #e.g. C:\Users\SBDD_Fall\DE\BB_Map_FGB_DE.gdb\NATL_Broadband_Map
theST = sys.argv[2]  #theState e.g. DE
theOF = sys.argv[3]  #theOutputFolder e.g. C:\Users\transfer\SBDD_Fall\DE

##global variables

##Comments
Running the tool
- After loading your data into the Data Transfer Model, add the tbx file above to 
	ArcCatalog.  We strongly suggest using ArcCatalog over ArcMap for a number of 
	reasons.  

- With the .tbx file added to ArcToolbox, run the script named SBDDCheckSubmission 
	(the only script in the toolbox).  The script will check the values in fields in 
	each feature class loaded in the transfer data model. It also performs the check 
	and validate geometry tools.  This script might take a long time due to the volume 
	of data in your submission.

- The arguments to run the script are; (a) the feature dataset inside the transfer 
	data model; (b) the two letter state abbreviation for your state/district/territory; 
	(c) the output folder for the reciept

- The script runs a series of logic checks (see SBDD_Reciept_Overview_v1.xls) 
	and outputs a file named: <output_folder><state_abbreviation>_<year>_<month>_<day>.txt
	(e.g. c:/users/DE_2001_3_14.txt).  This text file contains the results of the checks 
	run by the script.  The results of the submission are in this text file.

- You will need to check this script for any 'FAILED' printed results.  A FAILED 
	result means there are unexpected values in your data submission.  You will need 
	to locate the values, fix the issues and rerun the tool.

- We would like you to submit the reciept file (the .txt file generated by the tool) 
	with your submission.

NOTES:
- PLEASE NOTE: THIS TOOL RUNS THE ESRI CHECK AND REPAIR GEOMETRY TOOLS.  THESE TOOLS 
	MIGHT CHANGE RECORD NUMBERS, GEOMETRY AND/OR FEATURES ON YOUR DATA.  WE ARE RUNNING 
	THIS DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME OF NON-VALID GEOMETRIES SUBMITTED IN PAST SUBMISSION.  
	IT IS A BEST PRACTICE TO RUN THESE TOOLS INDIVIDUALLY ON SAMPLE DATA PRIOR TO 
	RUNNING THE CHECKSUBMISSION TOOL SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH GEOMETRY ISSUES  CONTAINED 
	IN YOUR SUBMISSION.

- THIS TOOL REQUIRES AN ARCINFO LICENSE TO RUN.  

- THIS TOOL WAS CREATED AND TESTED IN ARCGIS 10.0

##expected directories / files
- all states are expected to be in a file geodatabase conforming to the standard 
	w/ a feature dataset named "NATL_Broadband_Map"


##expected run time
about 20 minutes per state
